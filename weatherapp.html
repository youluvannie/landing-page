        <p>
            Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert. It may be made from milk or
            cream and is
            flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with
            fruit such as
            strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together.
            Food
            coloring is sometimes added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of
            water and
            stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. The result is a
            smooth,
            semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as
            its
            temperature increase
